locale_database is used to generate qlocale data from CLDR.

CLDR is the Common Locale Data Repository, a database for localized
data (like date formats, country names etc).  It is provided by the
Unicode consortium.

See cldr2qtimezone.py on how to update tables of Windows-specific
names for zones and UTC-offset zone names.
